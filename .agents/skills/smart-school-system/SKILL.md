# Smart School Enterprise System (ABLOB Platform) — IDEAI SCHOOL

The **Smart School Enterprise Platform** is a multi-tenant, role-governed education management and school administration ecosystem built on the **Liquid Glass Design System** (`liquid-glass-design-system`, `srievi-liquid-glass-standards`, and `shiliaiwei-liquid-glass-standards`). The default institutional branding is configured as **IDEAI SCHOOL**, with a centralized single-source brand architecture (`src/config/brand.ts`) designed for effortless 1-click rebranding across all web portals, mobile apps, and generated reports.

## 1. Centralized Institutional Brand Architecture

All branding, institutional name, contact details, academic session parameters, and logo placeholders are governed strictly from:
`src/config/brand.ts`

```typescript
export const BRAND: BrandConfig = {
  schoolName: "IDEAI SCHOOL",
  shortName: "IDEAI",
  schoolCode: "IDEAI-2026-HQ",
  tagline: "Intelligent Digital Education & Academic Infrastructure",
  logo: {
    url: null, // Blank placeholder for custom logo upload
    altText: "IDEAI SCHOOL Official Emblem",
    width: 140,
    height: 40,
  },
  contact: {
    email: "admin@ideaischool.edu",
    phone: "+855 23 888 999",
    address: "No. 128 Innovation Blvd, Tech Park",
    website: "https://ideaischool.edu",
  },
  academic: {
    currentSession: "2026-27",
    sessionStartMonth: "April",
    dateFormat: "DD/MM/YYYY",
    timezone: "Asia/Phnom_Penh (GMT+07:00)",
    currency: "USD",
    currencySymbol: "$",
  },
  theme: {
    superAdminColor: "#8E24AA",
    adminColor: "#0288D1",
    teacherColor: "#2563EB",
    studentColor: "#8BC34A",
    parentColor: "#E91E63",
    accountantColor: "#FF9800",
    receptionistColor: "#00BCD4",
    librarianColor: "#4CAF50",
  },
};
```

## 2. Icon, Typography & Local Asset Directives (MANDATORY)

1. **Mandatory Three-Font Architecture**:
   - **English System Font**: Strictly **Ubuntu** (`font-ubuntu` / `var(--font-ubuntu)`). Default font for all English UI, navigation, inputs, data grids, metrics, and labels.
   - **Khmer Primary Font**: Strictly **Google Sans** (`font-khmer` / `var(--font-google-sans)`) with line-height `1.45`-`1.50` for all Khmer UI copy and communication.
   - **Khmer Ceremonial Display Font**: Strictly **Moul** (`font-moul` / `var(--font-moul)`). Reserved exclusively for formal diplomas, certificates, and state headers. Rarely used.
2. **Local Internal Asset Storage Standard**:
   - Core fonts, brand assets, and icons MUST be self-hosted internally for zero CLS, offline resilience, and fast TTFB:
     - Local Fonts: `frontend/src/fonts/{ubuntu,google-sans,moul}/` (compiled via `next/font/local`) and `frontend/public/fonts/`.
     - Brand Logo: `frontend/public/images/logo.jpg` (Apple Mac minimalist geometric crest).
     - App Icon: `frontend/public/icons/app-icon.jpg` (macOS squircle liquid glass design).
     - User Uploads: `backend/storage/app/public/`.
3. **Primary Icon System: Google Material Symbols & Material Web**:
   - Primary resource: **[Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)** and **[Material Symbols (msicons.com)](https://msicons.com/)**.
   - Component package: `@material/web` (Google Material Web Components).
   - Component wrapper: `<MaterialIcon name="..." fill={bool} weight={400} />`.
   - **NO FontAwesome, NO Lucide overrides where Material Symbols are designated**.
4. **STRICT ZERO EMOJI POLICY**:
   - **NEVER** use emojis in UI components, headings, buttons, badges, tables, alerts, or source code.
   - Use clean, professional typography and solid Google Material Symbols only.
